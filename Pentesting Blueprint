# 1.PRE-ENGAGEMENT

During this pre-phase, a penetration testing company will outline the logistics of the test expectations, legal implications, objectives and goals the customer would like to achieve. 

Make sure you get written permission to test any third parties that own or operate target systems (MSSPs, cloud providers, ISPs, shared hosting environments, border routers, DNS servers, etc.

During the Pre-Engagement phase, the penetration testers should work with your company to fully understand any risks, your organizational culture, and the best pentesting strategy for your organization. You may want to perform a white box, black box, or gray box penetration test. Itâ€™s at this stage when the planning occurs along with aligning your goals to specific pentesting outcomes.


# 2.RECONNISANCE

Reconnaissance or Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering is an important first step in penetration testing. A pentester works on gathering as much intelligence on your organization and the potential targets for exploit.

Depending on which type of pentest you agree upon, your penetration tester may have varying degrees of information about your organization or may need to identify critical information on their own to uncover vulnerabilities and entry points in your environment.
